<TitleSection title="Resume" subtitle="My Vision & Me" />

My name is Simon.

![Hello, that's me.](../assets/images/simon.jpg)

I'm a visionary for software engineering and a pragmatist in writing code.
Since my studies I’m inspired by the expressive power of computer science. Numerous processes from the physical world can be simplified with a digital product. The computer is our tool to soon start realizing at low cost. It’s fine if it fails with the first attempt. With an iterative process, constant feedback from users and data-driven observations we can validate our idea early and regularly and improve our development process organically.

During my three years as a professional full stack developer I got the chance to move to the beautiful city of Lisbon. On top of my daily coding time in various projects I became a mentor for new hires. For each new portuguese colleague I had to come up with an optimal strategy for his onboarding. My key to success was to be patient to understand his level of knowledge first. I wanted to understand if he is a top-down or bottom-up learner. Then I thought of different ways to explain a subject and visualize it such that my mentee could actively dive into the complexity of a big software system. It makes me happy when people succeed with my support. And it's also selfish: I feel deepening my own knowledge every time I share it.

The amount of acquirable skills in IT are endless. One can get lost. The best ways to learn coding and software engineering is to _collaboratively_ work an a _project that matters to you_. Information needs a purpose to stick in our brains. That is why I encourage people to learn tech to achieve a certain goal, one that you stand behind. It might be a pet project you are passioned about, or it might be something that is useful for the public or even a company from the very start. **That motivating factor is the first key** to learn how to connect technologies to a working system.

**The second key is a mentor.** Information technology its derivatives tend to be complex (at least as complex as the complexity of the problems it solves). The first dive can perfectly happen on the basis of an online course, but soon a mentor to answer specific questions and to guide through a _focused_ learning path becomes crucial. That is why every software engineering company does peer reviews of code and architectural decisions.

The conclusion for working on software in teams is straightforward: **If a culture of conveying know-how to team mates prevails, even complex software projects will succeed, simply because everyone stays motivated and is at the edge of the team's proficiency.**

For the craft of coding, I’m supporting the following credos:

> Explicit is better than implicit

> Simple is better than complex

> Complex is better than complicated

Recently I decided I'm still too young to stay at one company until all my hair
is grey and I started to work as a trainer and freelancer in various fields. Checkout [what I can offer for

## Technology that I use and still like

The only cliche about programmers that holds true for me is my adoration
of coffee. I usually enjoy a _Flat White_ I produce manually by my old-school
_Bialetti_. Definitely a good start into a high motivation day using some of this technologies:

The language and its great standard library is so easy to learn. I became an expert in this language and enjoy working with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

I like it for its diversity, ecosystem and it is still the fastest way to build prototypes or combine existing systems.                                                                                                     |

When integrating microservices into modern cloud platforms' ecosystem, the main focus should be on clean APIs between services, to the "outside world" and the fine tuning of the services' interaction with the cloud's  built-in infrastructure. Over the course of three years, I learned how to make it a rock solid deployment strategy.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) & [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) (managed with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)) | I was lucky to work with both clouds on projects scaling to multiple regions. I'm used to having a staged deployment strategy with at least three stages and automated tests to ensure continuous deployments never break the production system. I was specifically involved in configuring cloud infrastructure to enable **system tests running over multiple services**, both on deployed systems and as part of a continuous integration pipeline. |

For most problems, even in distributed microservice architectures, (multiple) PostgreSQL databases are still the best choice for clean data organization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The app facilitates the work of thousands of employees. I was code owner for the **distributed & offline capable authentication process** and ensured its security. I also architectured asynchronous data synchronization mechanics for extensive base data. Currently I'm using Flutter in a pet project where I build an App to democratize transparent food production. |

For example, this very site is built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a static site generator based on [React](https://reactjs.org/) allowing me to write my blog articles in lovely simple [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).                                                                                                               |

In my first project at _freiheit.com_ I also used [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) to build a customizable real estate search.                                                                                                                                  |
