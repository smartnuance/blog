Hire me as a freelancer for the critical phase of your product. Profit from my profound experience with a [huge number of technologies](/resume). In many corporate and side projects I proofed how I do not only adapt a tech stack quickly but also thrive it forward to be simpler but complete enough to deliver stable software that we all actually want to use.

<Service title="Boost your team" icon={<UsersThree />}>

Delivering on my own is easy but limited by my finite time. That's why I prefer collaborations where I work closely with a team and empower them in a few months to do fine without me or having me just as an occasional reviewer or last resort for difficult decisions. I achieve this by coaching team members individually, exemplifying a culture of humble learning and teaching. I never capture knowledge, I share it openly until team members are perfectly ready to take over my lead. I ensure this by
- helping to find consensus of fundamental tech choices
- writing excellent documentation for technical design decisions and established engineering standards
- using [tutorial style docs and videos](/blog/flutter-admin-kit/) to provide a seemless on-boarding experience for new team joiners
