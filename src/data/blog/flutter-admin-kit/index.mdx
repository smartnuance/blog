## What is flutter admin kit?

The flutter admin kit combines the fine art of an interactive web frontend with a powerful data abstraction layer. The goal is
to provide a kit, also called a starter template, that reduces the boring boilerplate necessary to get the basics of authentication and CRUD functionality
on your models done. At the same time you should be able to use the component based approach of Flutter to create and plug your complex UI elements _wherever you want them_,
without starting over dealing with list paging/scrolling, URL routes setup, low-level form handling, savepoints when editing, error handling and all that stuff
we just expect _from a modern web interface_.

This is achieved by combining state-of-the-art libraries that give strong (and strict) guidelines that will keep the admin interface
cleanly organized and modular in certain concerns. For example you should be able to jump anywhere by a link, not breaking/loosing your state.
If a user has started a user journey that must be completed he should be informed about effects of switching to another view.

Technically these are the highlights implemented so far:

- Declarative routing via global state, organized with [flutter_riverpod](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_riverpod)

- Model list view dynamically generated from config files and an inspection API

- Authentication with OAuth based on auto-refreshed JWTs

- Debug panel for live inspection of global state for a nice learning experience :)

## State management

I'm going through the list of used packages and explain why they are useful. You can find the up-to-date list in [pubspec.yaml](https://github.com/smartnuance/flutter-admin-kit/blob/main/pubspec.yaml).

Then we see how state is organized in a composable way and how the visualization as a graph makes it simple and clear.
