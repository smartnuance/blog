premise: - attention management (filtering information IS NECESSARY)

sticky topics you are interested in

those you get updated regularily

relatedness is judged by community and discussed

making up your own conclusions and decide on possible actions (like voting) on topic (ref to separate article about fine-grained Coffee-E-democracy)
- demonstrate
- give away you fine-grained partial vote to somebody more informed


- no ML (collaborative filtering) for media selection (but ok for topic proposal)
