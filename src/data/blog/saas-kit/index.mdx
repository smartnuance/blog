Check out the <a href="https://admin-kit.smartnuance.com" target="_blank">demo</a> backed by an instance of the SaaS kit.

View [code on Github](https://github.com/smartnuance/saas-kit).

## What is the go SaaS kit?

The kit combines the benefits of a streamlined developer experience known from monolithic frameworks with the superior design advantages of [microservices (checkout my separate article)](/blog/microservices).

Technically these are the highlights implemented so far:

- Authentication service with a hierarchical role model for organizing permissions

- Feature service for managing events and workshops

- Tooling to run all services in a single process during development

**Coming soon**

- Continuous delivery support inclusive IaC for [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) for orchestrating the individual services

- Integration test setup and examples for inter-service feature tests
