This page is a little self-centered. I talk about a specific but diverse topic, about myself.

![Hello, that's me.](./simon.jpg)

I'm a visionary for software engineering and a pragmatist in writing code.
As a kid I tried doing art on my father's old Macintosh. When I
learned programming Java at middle school, the immense possibilities of the
digital world became apparent to me. It was like LEGO, just with an infinite
number of pieces. Until today I still prefer blank paper to develop ideas and I
believe most great engineering is originating from a pencil. Code is what makes
software engineering products accessable for everyone. Sometimes a quick
prototype is what validates an idea. Sometimes we want to reach clients of a
full continent or even the whole world. And the difference is made just by the
click-clacks of my keyboard.

Recently I decided I'm still too young to stay at one company until all my hair
is grey and I started to work as a freelancer. Checkout [what I can offer for
you](/ "Offers").


## Technology that I use and still like

The only cliche about programmers that holds true for me is my adoration
of coffee. I usually enjoy a _Flat White_ I produce manually by my old-school
_Bialetti_. Definitely a good start into a high motivation day using some of this technologies:

The language and its great standard library is so easy to learn. I became an expert in this language and enjoy working with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

I like it for its diversity, ecosystem and it is still the fastest way to build prototypes or combine existing systems.                                                                                                     |

Since the cloud providers leave the fine tuning of their services to developers, I learned about its strengths and pitfalls and how to make it a rock solid deployment strategy.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) & [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) (managed with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)) | I was lucky to work with both clouds on projects scaling to multiple regions. I'm used to having a staged deployment strategy with at least three stages and automated tests to ensure continuous deployments never break the production system. I was specifically involved in configuring cloud infrastructure to enable **system tests running over multiple services**, both on deployed systems and as part of a continuous integration pipeline. |

For most problems, even in distributed microservice architectures, (multiple) PostgreSQL databases are still the best choice for clean data organization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The app facilitates the work of thousands of employees. I was code owner for the **distributed & offline capable authentication process** and ensured its security. Also I architectured complex form validation based on data fetched from asynchronous synchronization of huge amounts of base data.                |

In my first project at _freiheit.com_ I also used [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) to build a customizable real estate search.                                                                                                                                  |
