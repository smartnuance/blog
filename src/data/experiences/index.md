This page is a little self-centered. I talk about a specific but diverse topic, about myself.

![Hello, that's me.](./simon.jpg)

I'm a visionary for software engineering and a pragmatist in writing code.
As a kid I tried doing art on my father's old Macintosh. When I
learned programming Java at middle school, the immense possibilities of the
digital world became apparent to me. It was like LEGO, just with an infinite
number of pieces. Until today I still prefer blank paper to develop ideas and I
believe most great engineering is originating from a pencil. Code is what makes
software engineering products accessable for everyone. Sometimes a quick
prototype is what validates an idea. Sometimes we want to reach clients of a
full continent or even the whole world. And the difference is made just by the
click-clacks of my keyboard.

Recently I decided I'm still too young to stay at one company until all my hair
is grey and I started to work as a freelancer. Checkout [what I can offer for
you](/ "Offers").

Oh and one more thing: The only cliche about programmers that holds true for me is my adoration
of coffee. I usually enjoy a _Flat White_ I produce manually by my old-school
_Bialetti_. Definitely a good start into a high motivation day!
