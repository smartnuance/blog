I'm proud to learn from and work on fundamental blockchain infrastructure at [Papers AG](https://papers.ch). While the company is active in mobile security and multiple blockchain technologies, our team is currently focused on the Polkadot & Kusama ecosystem, building [Acurast](https://acurast.com/). Follow my contributions in the [public repos](https://github.com/acurast).
