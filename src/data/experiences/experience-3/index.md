At the pure engineering company
[freiheit.com](https://freiheit.com/en/) I was building highly scalable systems [as a
full stack developer](/blog/learnings/ "Learnings as a full
stack developer"). From requirements engineering to SRE, I was involved in all
steps to build world-class software products, mostly deployed to the cloud but
also inside cars of a major car manufacturer. My journey at
[freiheit.com](https://freiheit.com/en/) got extra exciting when I was selected
to **build up the first international engineering hub** in Lisbon, Portugal. The
initiative got a huge success and I could outgrow myself in one of my strength:
integrating new hires into a highly motivated and effective team following
highest engineering standards.
