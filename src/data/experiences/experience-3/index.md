At the pure engineering company
[freiheit.com](https://freiheit.com/en/) I was building highly scalable systems [as a
full stack developer](/blog/learnings/ "Learnings as a full
stack developer"). From requirements engineering to SRE, I was involved in all
steps to build world-class software products, mostly deployed to the cloud but
also inside the cars of a major car manufacturer.
