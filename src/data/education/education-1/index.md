My roots are swiss and after Gymnasium I moved to Zurich to start my studies in Computer Science at
[ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). While I enjoyed the diversity of subjects at my beautiful Gymnasium in Wohlen AG,
I was eager to enter the world of science and challenges that would really ask for my focus. The first years were tough, but priceless to learn how to get
self-organized and tackle any level of complexity.
