My educational path might be impressive, but I'm more
proud of my contributions to this
[students association](https://tanzquotient.org/en/), where I helped to scale
dance classes to thousands of pariticipants every year by digitizing all
repetitive processes. The team backing that association was built by students of
various backgrounds and all of them did join the project solely by intrinsic
motivation (and some free pizza). Since I experienced this environment of people
with a strong common goal, helping each other to push boundaries, I believe
every team should carefully cultivate the sources of motivation.
