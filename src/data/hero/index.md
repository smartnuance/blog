content: "I'm a visionary for software engineering and a pragmatist in writing code. I believe great engineering is originating from a pencil. Coding is the attempt to transfer as much as possible from your creative solution into a working digital system. It needs careful crafting, frequent validation and the constant will to do and learn from small mistakes. Only then our software product will be useful to users and accessable from wherever they are."
