{{<figure src="HackersWanted-Simon.jpg" caption="A campaign of freiheit.com to find new engineers for their new Lisbon office.">}}

As of December 2017 I worked in three different, lovely teams for three
different customers, including a major car manufacturer and large food retailer.
My role was a full stack developer. It was noticeably cool of my employer
[freiheit.com](https://freiheit.com/en/) that this position in fact meant I was
just doing about everything that is fun about a digital product.

- I planned the key features with stake holders and product owners, ensuring
  they target high business value
- With my team we refined small-grained technical stories from this goals. This
  stories are pieces of software that can be **individually built, tested and
  accepted to _be done_**.
- Then the time has come to run for two weeks straight to hold the promise for
  the iteration. While satisfying the minimal requirements of each story is
  usually easy, it is a challenge to follow the steadily improved engineering
  standards every moment. But this process of structuring your imagination into
  a series of keywords a machine understands, taking seamingly small choices
  that built up bigger parts working smoothly together results in a high quality
  of the overall system.

We used the code ownerwhip principle and I was usually responsible for two or
three backend services of crucial importance, often security related or part of
the more involved parts of searching, filtering and caching data.

- As developers, every team member was in full control of getting their
  contributions through the CI/CD pipelines and into the production system
  (always in the cloud, different cloud providers)
