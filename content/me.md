title: My Vision & Me
---

{{<figure src="/img/simon.jpg" caption="Hello that's me.">}}

Hi there! If you are searching for Simon you are right here. This page is a
little self-centered. I talk about a specific but diverse topic, about myself.

I suppose I'm a visionary when it comes to software, and a pragmatist when it
comes to code. As a kid I experimented with talking to computers like to human
beings. It never worked out. But then, I learned programming and the size and
possibilities of the digital world became apparent to me.

More and more programming languages crossed my way, as well as natural ones,
since I used to travel a lot and lived in multiple countries. My professional
work as a full stack developer led me from Hamburg to Lisbon two years ago and I
got attached to this city, where I'm currently still living. I never stopped
beeing curious about the diversity and complexity of the world. That is why I
keep staying impressed by how I can create software products in the digital
world and running them out there, world-wide, by code just originating from the
click-clacks of my keyboard. After all both worlds are deeply connected and, for
me, lively and exiting to explore.

By now it might not surprise you that the only cliche about programmers that
holds true for me, is me _adoring_ coffee. I usually enjoy a _Flat White_ I
produce manually by my old-school _Bialetti_. Only recently I heard about a new
creation called _Flat Mocha_, which I imagine to look like this:

Now let's go in order:

My roots are swiss and I **graduated in Computer Science** from
[ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) where I specialized in distributed systems
and programming methodology. [My Master
Thesis]({{< ref "/posts/master-thesis" >}} "Master Thesis") about a static
analyser was awarded with the highest possible grade. Impressive, but I'm more
proud of my contributions to this
[students association](https://tanzquotient.org/de/), where I helped to scale
dance classes to thousands of pariticipants every year by digitizing all
repetitive processes. The team backing that association was built by students of
various backgrounds and all of them did join the project solely by intrinsic
motivation (and some free pizza). Since I experienced this environment of people
with a strong common goal, helping each other to push boundaries, I believe
every team should have this at its core and I'm wondering if smart mechanics can
guide teams to build that basis themselves.

After studies, I worked three years at the pure engineering company
[freiheit.com](https://freiheit.com/en/) building highly scalable systems [as a
full stack developer]({{< ref "/posts/learnings/index" >}} "Learnings as a full
stack developer"). From requirements engineering to SRE, I was involved in all
steps to build world-class software products, mostly deployed to the cloud but
also inside cars of a major car manufacturer. My journey at
[freiheit.com](https://freiheit.com/en/) got extra exciting when I was selected
to **build up the first international engineering hub** in Lisbon, Portugal. The
initiative got a huge success and I could outgrow myself in one of my strength:
integrating new hires into a highly motivated and effective team with a
community that is motivating to work in and supportive to each other.

Recently I decided I'm still too young to stay at one company until all my hair
is grey and I started to work as a freelancer. Checkout [what I can offer for
