title: Me & My Vision
---

I'm Simon Wehrli, a full stack developer from Switzerland currently living in
Portugal. I **graduated in Computer Science** from
[ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) and specialized in distributed systems and
programming methodology. [My Master's Thesis]({{< ref "/posts/master-thesis" >}}
"Master's Thesis") about a static analyser was awarded with the highest possible
grade. Impressive, but I'm more proud of my contributions to the
[students association](https://tanzquotient.org/de/), where I helped to scale
dance classes to thousands of pariticipants every year by digitizing all
repetitive processes.

After studies, I worked three years at the pure engineering company
[freiheit.com](https://freiheit.com/en/) building highly scalable systems [as a
full stack developer]({{< ref "/posts/learnings/index" >}} "Learnings as a full
stack developer"). From requirements engineering to SRE, I was involved in all
steps to build world-wide deployed software, mostly deployed to the cloud but
also inside cars of a major car manufacturer. My journey at
[freiheit.com](https://freiheit.com/en/) got extra exciting when I was selected
to **build up the first international engineering hub** in Lisbon, Portugal. The
initiative got a huge success and I could outgrow myself in one of my strength:
integrating new hires into a highly motivated and effective team with a
community that is fun to work in. I got attached to Lisbon and all of Portugal's
culture and currently still staying there most of the time.

Recently I decided I'm still too young to stay at one company until all my hair
is grey and I started to work as a freelancer, seeking for challenging projects
that I can add a lot of value to. I usually collaborate with teams from the
customer or build my own team with the skills best aligned with the project
requirements.

| [Golang](https://golang.org/)                                                               | Used it daily for my full-time job to build **microservices**. The language and its great standard library is so easy to learn. I became an expert in this language and enjoy working with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

I like it for its diversity, ecosystem and it is still the fastest way to build prototypes or combine existing systems for me.                                                                                              |
| [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)                    | It was the backbone of **running incrementally updated microservices** at work. Since the cloud providers leave the fine tuning of their services to developers, I learned about its strengths and pitfalls and how to make it a rock solid deployment strategy.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) & [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) | I was lucky to work with both clouds on projects scaling to multiple regions. I'm used to having a staged deployment strategy with at least three stages and automated tests to ensure continuous deployments never break the production system. I was specifically involved in configuring cloud infrastructure to enable **system tests running over multiple services**, both on deployed systems and as part of a continuous integration pipeline. |
| [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)                                                   | Some classic things are here to stay. For most problems, even in distributed micro service architectures, (multiple) PostgreSQL databases are still the best choice for clean data organization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

The app facilitates the work of thousands of employees. I was code owner for the **distributed & offline capable authentication process** and ensured its security.                                                                                                                                                       |

In all other cases good old plain JavaScript or something like [Knockout JS](https://knockoutjs.com/) added to an existing site did the the job for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [Java EE](https://www.oracle.com/ch-de/java/technologies/java-ee-glance.html)               | In my internship at [ergon](https://www.ergon.ch/en) I got in touch with the Java EE stack and built a visual configurator with Java Swing and custom extensions. In my first project at _freiheit.com_ I also used [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) to build a customizable real estate search.                                                                                                                                  |
